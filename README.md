### 1-
- Write a function that flattens a list. Its elements can consist of multi-layered lists (such as [[3],2]) or non-scalar data. For example:
> input: [[1,'a',['cat'],2],[[[3]],'dog'],4,5]
> output: [1,'a','cat',2,3,'dog',4,5]

### 2-
- Write a function that reverses the elements inside the given list. If the elements inside the list also contain the list, reverse their elements as well. For example:
> input: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
> output: [[7, 6, 5], [4, 3], [2, 1]]
